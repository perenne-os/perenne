# Boot smoke test: cross-builds the kernel, boots it headless under QEMU
# (riscv64 virt + OpenSBI), captures the serial console, and asserts the
# Phase 2a milestones (greeting, survived breakpoint, >= 2 timer ticks),
# the Phase 2b milestones (Sv39 paging on, W^X blocking a rodata write, a
# frame alloc/free round-trip), and the Phase 3b-ii milestone — each U-mode
# task runs in its own address space (its own satp), the 3b-i run-queue proofs
# still hold (two U-mode tasks round-robin via the yield syscall and exit
# cleanly, a U-mode task is preempted by the timer), and a snoop task that
# reaches into another task's memory is contained (cross-task isolation).
# (Phase 2c/3b-i scheduling are now proven by the broader 3b-ii run-queue demo.)
# Usage: ./tools/test-qemu.ps1     (exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail)
